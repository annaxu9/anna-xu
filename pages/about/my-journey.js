            On a good day, coding can be a fun little puzzle. On a bad day, coding can make you want to commit violence against the most expensive thing you own. As someone who didnâ€™t really code before college, I found myself often fighting an uphill battle.

            That's why, before my senior year, I took a gap semester. While I did have a job and some extracurriculars, without classes I was able to carve out the space to finally fill the conceptual holes I had, practice without much stress, and explore. I'm proud to share that where I once felt apprehension at the thought of opening VSCode, I now engage with it spontaneously and many times even eagerly. Below, you'll find a snapshot of my journey during this period, as well as my aspirations and plans for moving forward.
