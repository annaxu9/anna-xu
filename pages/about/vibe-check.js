            &emsp;&emsp; I created Vibe Check because I love music and colors. <br></br>
            &emsp;&emsp; Music helps me recenter and (literally) get into a rhythm, whether thatâ€™s for coding, running, or just vibing. I listen to hours and hours of music every day. And this is not an exaggeration. Spotify Wrapped exposed my listening habits, and I had somehow accululated over 100,000 minutes this past yearðŸ˜…. <br></br>
            &emsp;&emsp; Color, to me, is like the spice of life (I must find a less cheesy way to put this). While we arenâ€™t always cognizant of it, the colors that we are surrounded by affect us much more than we realize. Imagine if the sky changed colors every dayâ€¦ that would be crazy! Forget about seasonal depressionâ€”we would have to worry about color sickness or something. Practically speaking though, as an artist color has always stressed me out because itâ€™s the most noticeable part of a project but also the easiest to mess up. <br></br>
            &emsp;&emsp; <span className="bg-melrose100">Both color and music have the power to set a vibe.</span> Over my gap, I wondered if I could somehow connect the two. Why? I donâ€™t know? Sounded cool! With Vibe Check you can search any song in Spotifyâ€™s database and see its data. I also worked on an algorithm that gives the song a color scheme. This is still a work in progress but feel free to play around and explore :)
