            <p className="sm:w-3/4 p-2 m-2 bg-lightgray mb-8">
            On a good day, coding is a fun, invigorating puzzle. On a bad day, coding is... less fun. As someone who didn&apos;t really code before college, I found myself often fighting an uphill battle.

            That&apos;s why, before my senior year, I took a gap semester. While I taught CS50 and had extracurricular commitments, without classes I was able to carve out the space to finally fill my conceptual holes, practice without much stress, and explore. With a background in journalism, I used an investigative approach to learning the fundamental web development conceptsâ€”always asking questions and never giving up. When I used to feel apprehension at the thought of opening VSCode, I now engage with the application spontaneously and many times even eagerly.
