                <p class="text-blue-900 mb-2">Water Lilies is a series of approximately 250 oil paintings by French Impressionist Claude Monet (1840–1926). The paintings depict his flower garden at his home in Giverny, and were the main focus of his artistic production during the last thirty years of his life. Many of the works were painted while Monet suffered from cataracts.</p>
                <p class="text-blue-900 mb-2">The paintings are on display at museums all over the world, including the Musée Marmottan Monet in Paris, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Saint Louis Art Museum, the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri, the Carnegie Museum of Art, the National Museum of Western Art in Tokyo, the Portland Art Museum and the Legion of Honor.</p>
                <p class="text-blue-900 mb-2">There is a serene beauty to them. I love the impressionist style and am moved by Monet’s dedication.</p>
                <p class="text-blue-900 mb-2">As for Monet's emotional state during this time, it's a bit complex. On one hand, he was deeply committed to his art and found great joy in painting his beloved garden at Giverny, where the water lilies were located. On the other hand, he also faced personal challenges, including the loss of his second wife, Alice, and his own declining health. These factors likely influenced his mood and may have contributed to the introspective and somewhat melancholic nature of his later works.</p>
                <p class="text-blue-900">Water lilies are often associated with birth and resurrection.</p>
